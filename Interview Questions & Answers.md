This file contains common **Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL)** interview questions along with answers. Questions are divided into **Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced** levels to help you prepare effectively.

## 🟢 Beginner Level

### Q1: What is software testing?
**A:** Software testing is the process of evaluating a system or its components to determine whether it meets specified requirements and to identify defects.

### Q2: What is the difference between a defect, error, and failure?
**A:** 
- **Error:** A human mistake in coding, design, or requirement.  
- **Defect (Bug):** A flaw in the software product caused by an error.  
- **Failure:** When the software does not perform as expected during execution.

### Q3: What are the seven principles of testing?
**A:** 
1. Testing shows presence of defects, not absence.  
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible.  
3. Early testing saves time & cost.  
4. Defect clustering exists.  
5. Pesticide paradox: repeating same tests won’t find new defects.  
6. Testing is context dependent.  
7. Absence-of-errors fallacy: software can be defect-free but still fail to meet requirements.

### Q4: What is the difference between verification and validation?
**A:**  
- **Verification:** Are we building the product right? (process-oriented)  
- **Validation:** Are we building the right product? (product-oriented)

## 🟡 Intermediate Level

### Q5: What is the difference between static and dynamic testing?
**A:**  
- **Static Testing:** Reviewing documents, code inspection, walkthroughs (no execution).  
- **Dynamic Testing:** Executing the code to find defects.

### Q6: Explain the SDLC models in context of testing.
**A:** Common SDLC models include:
- **Waterfall:** Sequential, testing after development.  
- **V-Model:** Testing phases correspond to development phases.  
- **Agile:** Continuous testing in iterations/sprints.

### Q7: Name some black-box testing techniques.
**A:**  
- Equivalence Partitioning  
- Boundary Value Analysis  
- Decision Table Testing  
- State Transition Testing

### Q8: What is a test case? What are its components?
**A:**  
A test case is a set of conditions or steps used to verify functionality. Components include:
- Test ID  
- Test description  
- Preconditions  
- Steps  
- Expected results  
- Actual results  
- Status (Pass/Fail)

## 🔴 Advanced Level

### Q9: What is risk-based testing?
**A:** Testing approach where testing priority is based on business risk, severity, and probability of defects.

### Q10: Explain exploratory testing.
**A:** Simultaneous learning, test design, and execution without predefined scripts, relying on tester’s experience and intuition.

### Q11: What is equivalence partitioning vs boundary value analysis?
**A:**  
- **Equivalence Partitioning:** Dividing input data into equivalent classes where testing one value represents all.  
- **Boundary Value Analysis:** Testing at edges of equivalence classes (e.g., min/max limits).

### Q12: What is the role of a tester in Agile?
**A:**  
- Participate in sprint planning & backlog grooming  
- Write and execute automated & manual tests  
- Collaborate with developers & product owners  
- Continuous integration and regression testing  

### Q13: Name some popular testing tools and their purpose.
**A:**  
- Selenium: Web automation  
- JIRA: Bug tracking & test management  
- QTest / TestRail: Test case management  
- JMeter / LoadRunner: Performance testing

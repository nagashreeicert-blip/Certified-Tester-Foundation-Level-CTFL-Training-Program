# 📘 CTFL Training Program Overview  
## **Your CTFL Certification Is Not Just a Document — It's a Career Accelerator**

Many testers feel stuck:  
- Applications ignored despite years of experience  
- HR filters rejecting them due to “no certification”  
- Stagnant in manual testing roles while certified testers move to automation, QA engineering, and test strategy positions  

CTFL fixes this.  
Most companies use ISTQB as a **mandatory screening filter**, and applicant-tracking systems often shortlist certified candidates first.  
Even with strong practical skills, **without CTFL, you remain invisible** to many quality assurance career opportunities.

This program is built to ensure you get noticed.
